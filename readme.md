#Regit

Allows for asset full text search currently with image, audio and video media types.

Issues with npm installation through vagrant/homestead so additional css file added manually rather than compiled
through from sass via webpack.

###TODO

* Pull page link info from main API data pull for pagination link creation with assoc route setup.
* Unit tests for formatting functions
* Add additional inputs for different search option types available via API
* Allow search via AJAX for more seamless page interaction
* Add animation for page listing entries and information display
* JS plugin use for nicer audio/video playback
